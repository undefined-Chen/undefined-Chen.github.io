_Heated Rivalry_, since its release in November, has swept through global pop culture. The series tells the story of two fictional male ice hockey players—Shawn Holland, a Japanese-Canadian portrayed by Hudson Williams, and Ilya Rozanov, a Russian played by Connor Story—who develop a secret romantic relationship while maintaining a public rivalry throughout their hockey careers.

Everyone wants a piece of the action, and the NHL—the league **widely regarded as the most anti-LGBTQ+ sports organization in North America**—is no exception.

The Montreal Canadiens, the real-life team that serves as the prototype for Shawn Holland’s team in the show, [played a trailer for *Heated Rivalry* during their Pride Night event on December 9 local time](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSF4WpyjLQ3/?img_index=1), when they hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning.

The Boston Bruins, the real-world counterpart to Ilya Rozanov’s team in the series, [played *All The Things She Said*, the show's iconic background music](https://www.tiktok.com/@kaylamaela/video/7584663764692258078), during their home game against the Utah Mammoths on December 16 local time, and later posted related content on social media during their home matchup against the Montreal Canadiens on December 23 local time.

Later, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated in a [January 16 interview with *The Athletic*](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6975677/2026/01/15/heated-rivalry-nhl-gary-bettman-hockey/) that he had binge-watched all six episodes of the series in one night, and also claimed that “the league had ‘meaningfully embraced’ the LGBTQ+ community.”

[*The Hollywood Reporter* reported](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/) that the NHL “has been trying to broaden its appeal to gay sports fans with LGBTQ-themed events and nights.” Yet if we simply rewind the clock by two years, it becomes clear that such a statement is not only inaccurate but absurd.

In June 2023, the NHL announced a ban prohibiting teams from wearing specialty jerseys, including Pride-themed rainbow jerseys, during warmups, practices, or games. Shortly after the start of the 2023–24 season, the league further announced [a ban on players using Pride tape to show support for the LGBTQ+ community](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/38625137/pride-tape-makers-disappointed-nhl-ban). Later that same month, the league [reversed the Pride tape ban](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/38734725/nhl-reverses-new-ban-pride-tape-warmups), not because it recognized the fundamental flaws in the policy, but as a “forced concession” in response to public backlash and protests from players like [Arizona Coyotes defenseman Travis Dermott](https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/38720616/arizona-coyotes-travis-dermott-uses-pride-tape-nhl-ban) and [Philadelphia Flyers forward Scott Laughton](https://allphly.com/scott-laughton-says-hell-still-wear-pride-tape-regardless-of-nhl-ban/).

If the NHL truly embraced the LGBTQ+ community as Gary Bettman claims, or as *The Hollywood Reporter* suggests, such a ban should never have existed in the first place, let alone required public outrage to be rescinded. Even if we generously assume that the reversal stemmed from a genuine change of heart by Bettman, we should have seen tangible follow-up actions over the past two seasons. Yet the reality tells a different story.

Despite continuing to brand itself with slogans like “Hockey Is For Everyone” and maintaining its partnership with [You Can Play](https://www.youcanplay.org/) (though we’ve seen little evidence of its impact), the NHL has consistently failed to give meaningful visibility to LGBTQ+ issues on its biggest stages. Even the NFL—often stereotyped as more conservative—aired a Super Bowl ad titled *Football is GAY*. Meanwhile, the NHL has never once allocated even 30 seconds of airtime to LGBTQ+ representation during high-profile events like the All-Star Game or the Winter Classic.

{{< youtube q4c9A8TO3Zg >}}

The above phenomenon makes Gary Bettman’s recent statement—“the league has ‘meaningfully embraced’ the LGBTQ+ community”—appear even more absurd and laughable. If the league were truly “meaningfully embracing” the LGBTQ+ community, it could have started taking concrete actions over the past two years, rather than waiting for a TV drama to become a cultural phenomenon before even pretending to act. And even this statement itself can hardly be considered “action.” The interview was published over a month ago, yet the league has still taken no tangible steps to put Bettman’s claim of “meaningfully embracing” the LGBTQ+ community into practice.

If we closely examine Bettman’s remarks in that interview, we find that—even within the article itself—his attitude toward the LGBTQ+ community hardly comes across as genuinely supportive.

> I thought the storyline was very compelling and a lot of fun, because I could (see) where they were picking at things that we had in the past, whether it was (Olympics) in Sochi or the All-Star Game in Tampa. It was very well done.
> 
> “I think it’s a wonderful story,” Bettman said. “The content, particularly for young people, might be a little spicy. And so you have to balance that out in terms of how you embrace (the show).”

Bettman’s description is steeped in the arrogance of privilege. He calls the storyline “compelling and a lot of fun” and “wonderful”—a display of baffling emotional tone-deafness. The two protagonists in *Heated Rivalry* love under immense difficulty, and the source of that hardship requires no interpretation: the show explicitly depicts them navigating a professional environment saturated with homophobia and toxic masculinity—the very environment whose real-world apex is overseen by none other than Bettman himself.

For Bettman, the characters’ struggle to come out is just gripping drama, an entertaining plot twist. But for real LGBTQ+ players, it is a Damoclean sword that could end their careers at any moment. As league commissioner, he should feel shame about this reality—not treat athletes’ existential crises as light entertainment.

Much of what Bettman finds “wonderful” likely stems from the show’s artfully constructed, almost utopian happy ending. Seeing the protagonists finally achieve happiness, he seems to assume the real-world problem has already been solved. But reality doesn’t lie: as of February 2026, [the NHL remains the only men’s professional sports league in North America with zero openly gay current or former players](https://www.outsports.com/2025/10/10/24120104/nhl-gay-players-history-luke-prokop/). Luke Prokop—though publicly out—is still playing for the Bakersfield Condors, the Edmonton Oilers’ AHL affiliate, and thus does not count as an NHL player.  

Bettman not only fails to recognize that this “neatly wrapped” ending was built on years of pain and struggle—he also fails to grasp that in the real NHL, there is no screenwriter’s “golden hand” to protect players. There are no Ilyas or Shanes. Only unnamed players who, upon hearing homophobic slurs in the locker room, can do nothing but force an awkward laugh along with the rest.

Bettman also describes the show as “spicy.” Admittedly, the series contains numerous explicit scenes. Yet he **completely skips over** the **core conflict** driving the narrative: the protagonists’ **struggles with self-identity and their professional survival**. If the league had truly “meaningfully embraced” the LGBTQ+ community, this would be precisely the issue it must address.

Moreover, as commissioner of a league widely regarded as one of the most violent non-combat sports in the world, Bettman appears to **not consider** on-ice **trash talk** and **physical aggression** as something young viewers need protection from or require “balancing” in terms of exposure. But the moment the screen shows **two men holding hands, kissing, or falling in love**, Bettman suddenly believes youth must be shielded—and that we must “balance how we embrace” such content.

Bettman assumes that watching the show means he understands it. But if he truly understood the story, he—as the head of the institution that created this toxic environment—should feel profound unease, not amusement. An organization that has “meaningfully embraced” LGBTQ+ people would never allow its star athletes to live decades in lies just for loving someone.  

Bettman’s shallow praise reveals that his so-called “embrace” is nothing more than performative—a case of Lord Ye’s fondness for dragons. According to [*The Harvard Independent*](https://harvardindependent.com/melting-the-ice-heated-rivalry-and-the-nhl/), interest in and sales of hockey tickets have surged significantly thanks to *Heated Rivalry*. Bettman enjoys the traffic and attention generated by LGBTQ+ stories—but he has no intention of tackling the central question the show raises: **Why is it so hard to simply be yourself in your league?**

Although the league officially banned all specialty jerseys—including those for charitable causes like “Hockey Fights Cancer”—the ban was in fact triggered specifically by Pride-themed jerseys. In the season prior to the announcement of the rainbow tape ban, multiple players refused to participate in pregame warmups when their teams wore Pride Night jerseys. Bettman’s stated justification for this ban was:

> What happened last year was that the issue of who wanted to wear a particular uniform on a particular night overshadowed everything that our clubs were doing. So what we said, instead of having that distraction and having our players have to decide whether or not they wanted to do something or not do something and be singled out, we said, 'Let's not touch that.'

Bettman defined social issues as “distractions” and suggested it would be better to simply say, “We’re not going to touch this area at all.” To avoid making a minority of people uncomfortable, the league has chosen to “throw the baby out with the bathwater,” abandoning its social responsibility as a corporation with significant cultural influence.  

As the fourth-largest professional sports league in North America, the NHL should aspire to more than merely “not making mistakes”—it should strive for “responsible influence.” Even while acknowledging that disagreements exist, the league must continue promoting positive values. What it ought to do is build bridges, not walls.  

Therefore, no matter how verbally supportive Bettman may sound on social issues, as long as the league continues to send the message—through silencing players and restricting expression—that “the NHL doesn’t care and doesn’t support” social issues, it will forever be seen as the most conservative of the major leagues.  

By contrast, the other three major North American sports leagues have handled social issues with far greater sophistication. Examples include [the NFL’s *My Cause My Cleats* initiative](https://mycausemycleats.org/), [the NBA’s actions during the Black Lives Matter movement](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29555143/nba-restart-how-nba-bubble-become-platform-social-justice), and [MLB’s decision to relocate its All-Star Game to uphold voting rights](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/mlb-will-move-all-star-game-to-denver-after-pulling-out-of-atlanta-over-voting-law.html).  

What sets these leagues apart from the NHL’s approach of “shutting people up” is their willingness to either create safe platforms for expression or take principled stands—even at the risk of public backlash.

In the latter half of his interview with *The Athletic*, Bettman didn’t even bother “pretending anymore.” He claimed:

> It wasn’t about Pride jerseys or Pride tape. It was about the fact of bringing things into the game that might not be embraced by the players wearing the jerseys. If some players don’t embrace the cause, whatever it is, then you create a distraction that doesn’t fulfill the purpose.

Although there are indeed players who have refused to wear Pride Night jerseys due to religious or geopolitical reasons, the reality—according to both [*USA Today*’s anonymous survey of 35 NHL players](https://www.startribune.com/survey-97-percent-of-nhl-players-would-accept-openly-gay-teammate/327947141) and [ESPN’s anonymous poll across the four major North American sports leagues](https://www.outsports.com/2012/10/14/4053794/majority-of-62-pro-athletes-polled-by-espn-in-favor-of-gay-marriage/)—is that the majority of NHL players do not oppose LGBTQ+ equality. In this context, Bettman’s excuse about avoiding “distractions that don’t fulfill the purpose” sounds like pure fantasy.

When the league chooses to sacrifice **the visibility of an entire community** just to avoid making that tiny minority—3% (per *USA Today*) or 8% (per ESPN)—feel “uncomfortable” or “singled out”; when the league refuses to actively support, encourage, or even defend LGBTQ+ inclusion, yet puts on a performative show of allyship the moment it sees revenue flowing in from that very community; and when the league maintains only symbolic partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations like You Can Play while taking zero substantive steps forward, then tell me, Gary Bettman: is **this** what you call having “‘meaningfully embraced’ the LGBTQ+ community”?!

Finally, I’d like to close this post by quoting sportswriter Frankie de la Cretaz—because at this point, I’m utterly exhausted trying to critique the NHL.

{{< quote author="Frankie de la Cretaz" source="Out of Your League - sorry but I don't give a fuck that the NHL has embraced 'heated rivalry'" url="https://www.thefrankiedlc.news/p/sorry-but-i-don-t-give-a-fuck-that-the-nhl-has-embraced-heated-rivalry">}}
Do I hope that the Heated Rivalry effect will be one that begins the painstaking process of rooting out homophobia from the sport of hockey? Of course I do. But it’s going to take a real cultural change and an investment in the LGBTQ+ community that continues way after the hype from the gay hockey show has died down. Celebrating elements of queer community without actually celebrating and supporting the community itself isn’t worth shit. Especially not when members of our community are dying and being legislated out of existence by the current administration.
